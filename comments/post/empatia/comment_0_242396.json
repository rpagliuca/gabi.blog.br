I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear \nyour thoughts before writing. I've had a difficult \ntime clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out there.\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 \nminutes are generally lost just trying to figure out how to begin. Any \nrecommendations or hints? Many thanks! https://tylenol1st.com/"
