    "content": "Florida Georgia Line is my favourite country music band. Headliners Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard are those guys that could make anyone sing along with them. That's why I like to visit their shows. And - that's surprisingly wonderful - in 2019 they have CAN'T SAY IT AIN'T COUNTRY TOUR which covers all the USA towns and cities.
