    "content": "Breaking Benjamin is my favourite rock-band of 90s. Breaking Benjamin had so many hits! The ones I remember are 'The Diary of Jane', 'Tourniquet' and, of course their hit 'So Cold'. These are real songs, not fake like today! And it is sooo good that Breaking Benjamin have a tour in 2019-2020! So I'm going to attend Breaking Benjamin concert this year. The tour dates is here: <a href=\"https://breakingbenjaminconcerts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://breakingbenjaminconcerts.com</a>. Check it out and maybe we can even visit one of the Benjamin's together!"
