    "content": "6 Things You Need To Know Before Your First Erotic Massage \nIf you are ready and willing to try an erotic massage today, you need to know a couple of things. Many people don’t understand that such exciting sessions as a happy ending or Nuru massage come with certain nuances. \n1. Massage Parlors Are Discreet \nYou don’t need to go to another city or the nearby state to find a Nuru massage parlor. Most likely, there is one around the corner. You just don’t know that it’s there. \nThe trick is that parlors don’t have signs screaming about what’s inside. They are discreetly hidden behind plain doors in order to maintain your privacy. \n2. You Can Choose a Masseur \nAll clients have their special preferences, and the massage parlor owners understand that. That’s why you can choose a masseur out of several girls, who work in the parlor. You can do it either online or on the spot. \n3. Parlors Don’t Keep Records \nWhen you call to book a massage session, you can use any name you like. But even if you use your own, don’t worry. All evidence of your booking is destroyed the moment you leave the parlor. Your privacy is highly important to massage salons, and they maintain it impeccably. \n4. It’s Ok To Feel Nervous \nThe majority of clients feel nervous before their first erotic massage session. Don’t worry, masseurs know that and try hard to make you feel comfortable. In just a few minutes, you’ll forget about the pressure and start enjoying the process. \n5. You Can Adjust the Massage \nIn top-notch parlors, masseurs ask you about your preferences in order to adjust the massage accordingly. Don’t worry about sounding strange. Masseurs undergo special training to cater to all types of needs. It’s their job to make your experience unforgettable. But they can’t do it unless you share your desires. \n6. You Can Have an Orgasm \nWhen you order a happy ending massage, it means you get a naked body-to-body massage with hand relief. If you opt for a full-service massage, you get to have sex. \nhttps://nurulife.com/ \n<a href=\"https://nurulife.com/\" / rel=\"nofollow\">https://nurulife.com/</a>"
