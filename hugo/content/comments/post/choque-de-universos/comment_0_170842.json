In MMM there are no lenders and no debtors. Everything is very simple: one participant asks for help — another one helps. \nThe only thing that MMM demands from its participants is to be honest and kind to each other. You ask for financial help when you need it, you give financial help when you are able to do it. \n<a href=\"http://nigerian-mmm.net/\" / rel=\"nofollow\">nigeria mmm</a> \nhttp://nigerian-mmm.net/"
